# Illustration Images

These images are optional extras created to demonstrate what you can do with **Andy Sensor Card**.

The idea is simple: place an illustration as the card background and then use **badges** (value labels, icons, status indicators, etc.) on top of it to create a very intuitive and informative visualization (e.g., a heating system overview, ventilation status, tank levels, and more).
All images below were generated with AI tools. You’re welcome to use them as-is, or create your own images to match your setup and style.

> **Tip:** Prefer the `*_transparent.png` variants if you want to overlay the illustration on your own card background.
